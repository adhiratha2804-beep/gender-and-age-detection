# gender-and-age-detection
Project Overview
This project implements a Gender and Age Detection system using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques.
The system detects human faces from images/video and predicts:
Gender (Male / Female)
Age Group (e.g., 0–2, 15–20, 25–32, etc.)
The project uses CNN-based pre-trained models with OpenCV DNN module for real-time inference.
